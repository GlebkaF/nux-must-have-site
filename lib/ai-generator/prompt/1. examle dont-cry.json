  "genre": "Classic Rock Ballad",
  "sound_description": "Warm, rich, and expressive clean tone with a slight sparkle for the intro and verses; thick yet singing lead for solos; dynamic response to pick attack; moderate brightness and smooth sustain; present depth and gentle ambience.",
  "guitar_rig_description": "Noise gate: not used (signal is clean/low-gain). Compressor: used gently at the front for smooth sustain and even response, especially for arpeggiated parts. Overdrive/Distortion/Boost: overdrive pedal used as a light boost for solos to add sustain and mild grit; otherwise bypassed for clean parts. Amplifier: clean channel of a vintage-style tube amp for lush cleans, switched to lead channel or boosted for solos. Cabinet: 2x12 open-back cab emulation for airy, full-bodied tone. EQ: used post-amp to trim excess lows and shape mids for clarity. Modulation: chorus pedal used subtly in intro and clean sections for width; off during solos. Delay: analog-style delay with short repeats added in solos for depth and space. Reverb: plate or hall reverb used sparingly throughout for lush ambience, slightly increased in solos.",

  "additional_info": "Neck or middle pickup (often Slash's neck humbucker for solos, both pickups for intro/clean parts); Slash typically uses Les Paul-style guitars with medium-gauge strings; expressive bends and vibrato are key; volume and tone knob manipulation can help achieve dynamics."
